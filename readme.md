# Fox Craft 

This is my hack for the EOS Hackathon 2018. I forked [voxel.js](http://voxeljs.com) which gave me a mindcraft-esk game in the browser. I then made in-game NFTs on the EOS chain. 

The blockchain specific tools I used to build this hack include: [eosjs](https://www.google.com/search?q=eosjs&oq=eosjs&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j0l3.1748j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), [nodeos](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/overview-1), [cleos](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/cleos-overview) and an open source [NFT smart contract](https://github.com/unicoeos/eosio.nft).

## Demo
To view a demo, either watch the ```eos_hack_demo.mov``` in this repo at root level locally or watch the [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDq5fZz1js4).
